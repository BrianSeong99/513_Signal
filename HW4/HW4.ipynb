    "In this assignment, you will implement object detection using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) in Python. You will use the Darknet framework and pre-trained weights for YOLOv3, which can be found here: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/Links to an external site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a Python script that loads an image, runs it through the YOLOv3 model, and displays the image with bounding boxes around detected objects. You can use any image of your choice for this task.\n",

    "Here are the steps you should follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the necessary packages: numpy, opencv-python, and darknet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the pre-trained weights for YOLOv3 from the link above and place them in a directory called \"weights\"."
